## About Project: 
  ![Technology Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technology-HTML%20%7C%20CSS-green)
  ### This project is "assignment 11" of HTML, CSS module of [Full Stack Javascript Web Developer Bootcamp](https://ineuron.ai/course/Full-Stack-Javascript-Web-Developer) by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/c/HiteshChoudharydotcom) on [ineuron.ai](https://ineuron.ai/) platform. 
  
#### Requirement/Problem statement: 
- To convert a given design (PNG file attached at the end) into HTML, CSS code.
    - External libraries/frameworks shouldn't be used.
    - Responsiveness is required.

#### Learnings/experiences from building this project:
- I took around 15 hours to complete this project.
  - I estimated that I will be able to complete this project in 6 hours as my previous projects were similar to this. I feel the reason I took so long to complete this project because I had to take break from development for 5 to 6 days and hence my hold over coding got weaker. 
- Via building this project, my grip on flexbox became a lot stronger.
  - I faced a challenge which is, flex-wrap was not working in many of the sections. I took help from stackoverflow [link to the corresponding thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44135352/flex-wrap-is-not-wrapping-when-i-reduce-the-window-size) and resolved my issue.
- I can responsiveness more easily now.
